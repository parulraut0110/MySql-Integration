Introduction
This project is a simple Spring Boot application that connects to a MySQL database and performs CRUD operations on a Student entity. It demonstrates the use of JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interactions and integrates Lombok for boilerplate code reduction.

Features
Connect to a MySQL database
Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a Student entity
Demonstrates the use of JPA and Lombok
Configuration via application.properties
Technologies Used
Java 17
Spring Boot 3.3.0
MySQL
Maven
JPA
Lombok
Prerequisites
JDK 17 or higher
Maven 3.6.3 or higher
MySQL 5.7 or higher
Setup

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/integrate-mysql.git
cd integrate-mysql
Configure the database:

Create a database named SpringTest in MySQL. Update the database configuration in src/main/resources/application.properties with your MySQL credentials and database details.

Build the project:

sh
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application:

sh
Copy code

Explanation of Code
IntegrateMysqlApplication.java: The main class of the Spring Boot application containing the main method which serves as the entry point of the application.

MYSQLSpringTest.java: A placeholder class for potential test or demonstration purposes with an empty main method.

Student.java: An entity class representing the Student table in the database, using JPA annotations to map the class to the table and Lombok annotations to generate boilerplate code like getters, setters, and toString methods.

application.properties: Contains the configuration for the database connection and JPA settings.

pom.xml: The Maven configuration file that includes dependencies for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, MySQL connector, and Lombok.
